# How to contribute?
You will need to use Visual Studio 2017 (updated to the latest version prefered) and the Windows 10 Build 16299 SDK. Simply clone the repo to get started.
<p>Create a new branch at first and then make the changes you want, next, open a pull request so that we can discuss those changes and accept them, at last we will merge that branch with the _master branch üôè</p>
<p>I highly recommend reading through these sets of articles: <a href="https://guides.github.com">GitHub guides</a></p>


# What to Add:
<ul>
<li>Background process to keep updating weather without opening the app</li>
